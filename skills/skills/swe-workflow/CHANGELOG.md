# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- `references/definition-of-done.md` as a final completion gate for scope, correctness, project fit, validation, and final response requirements.
- `references/command-discovery.md` so agents discover validation commands from repo evidence instead of guessing.
- `references/risk-classification.md` for compact step-level risk review and mitigation.
- `references/project-agents-template.md` for optional target-repo `AGENTS.md` setup.
- `examples/evaluation-prompts.md` for optional workflow evaluation prompts.

### Changed
- Added concise `SKILL.md` reference-loading rules while keeping detailed quality guidance in reference files.
- Added a compact Validation Commands section and risk/mitigation quality prompts to the plan template.
- Documented production code-quality setup and repository bloat-control rules.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- `references/code-quality.md` as a reusable quality bar covering correctness, simplicity, maintainability, project fit, contracts, security, performance, and observability.
- Per-step Quality Checklist in `references/plan-template.md`, `SKILL.md`, and the worked plan example so agents record existing-pattern, contract, reuse, edge-case, and risk review before completion.

### Changed
- Strengthened `references/execute-step.md` with a Quality Gate Before Editing and implementation blockers tied to the reusable quality bar.
- Strengthened `references/verify-step.md` with explicit contract, security, data safety, performance, project-fit review rows and a final Quality Review gate.
- Updated planning docs and README structure references to include the reusable quality bar consistently.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Contract blocks** at the top of every reference file (first 5-10 rules). A low-thinking agent reading only the first 20-30 lines of any reference now gets every critical gate.
- **Design Decisions table** in the plan template. UX, schema, component, and API contract choices must be surfaced for user confirmation during planning — not assumed silently.
- **Design confirmation gate** in execute-step. Design-sensitive steps verify approach matches existing conventions or the Design Decisions table before implementing.
- **Design convention discovery** in create-plan. When a task touches UI, schema, or API, the agent searches for existing patterns, shared components, and reusable code before planning.
- **Reuse-before-create behavioral guard** (§4 in SKILL.md). Agents must search for existing equivalents before creating new components, utilities, or schema patterns; evidence of the search goes in Verified Facts.
- **Design discipline behavioral guard** (§5 in SKILL.md). Silent design choices are prohibited; design decisions must be confirmed by the user.
- **Bullet quality standard** in create-plan. Every plan bullet must name a tool (`edit`/`write`/`bash`), a file path, and the specific change.
- **Concrete example placeholders** in plan-template.md. Step fields now show realistic examples (tool-prefixed plan bullets, exact validation commands, explicit step dependencies, outcome sentences).
- **`references/plan-example.md`** — a complete, realistic 3-step filled-in plan example for low-thinking agents to copy from.
- **Append-only rule** for Context & Learnings in the plan template.
- **Silent design assumptions** anti-pattern added to SKILL.md.

### Changed
- All 11 reference files restructured with Contract blocks front-loaded as first section.
- Total reference file lines compressed from 1833 to 1086 (−41%) while adding new design discipline content. Verbose sections (examples, tables, repeated checklists) tightened without losing critical rules.
- Behavioral guard §4 "Code quality" split into §4 "Reuse before create" + §5 "Design discipline"; original code quality aspects covered by existing guards §1/§3/§6.
- Plan template `Deliverables` now includes "After this step: [observable outcome]" guidance.
- Plan template `Prerequisites` now includes "Files to modify:" and explicit step dependency examples.
- Plan file format contract rule updated to mention Design Decisions table.
- Clarification phase now includes design decision identification (require-clarification.md).
- Strengthened the Full workflow clarification gate (from pre-v1.7.0 commit): plans must use `Open Questions: None.`, unresolved questions must be asked in chat before plan creation/finalization or execution.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- Strengthened all-code-task behavioral guards with evidence-first, language-agnostic quality guidance: verify paths/imports/dependencies, avoid degraded correctness patterns, run formatter/format-checker when present, and fix introduced issues before completion.
- Added task-local Working Set and Verified Facts sections to the Full workflow plan template so agents record evidence for files, APIs, dependencies, conventions, and tests instead of relying on guesses.
- Reframed `plans/repo-map.md` as optional advisory project memory, not a mandatory file inventory; planning, execution, verification, persistence, resume, context dump, and reflection now prioritize task-local evidence and current-workspace verification.
- Updated README and the email-validation worked example to make `plans/context.md` and `plans/<task>.md` primary, with `plans/repo-map.md` optional/advisory.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **Skill `description` rewritten as an enforceable contract (845 chars).** The advertised description — the only part of the skill guaranteed to be in an agent's context — now explicitly instructs the agent to `read` SKILL.md, emit the triage block with the exact four labels, and use `references/plan-template.md` verbatim for Full-mode plans. It also names common violation shapes (freeform plans, inline `[STATUS]` headers, skipping triage).
- **SKILL.md restructured to front-load enforceable content.** First section is now "Contract" — a 16-line minimum-compliance block covering triage, Full-workflow triggers, pre-edit gate, plan file format, and one-step-at-a-time. The WRONG vs RIGHT anti-pattern block is promoted above Full Workflow. A third anti-pattern — "Triage skipped because the task seemed simple" — was added.
- The inline plan skeleton in SKILL.md was extracted to `references/plan-template.md` to remove duplication and give agents a concrete copy target.

### Added
- `references/plan-template.md` — canonical `plans/<task>.md` skeleton with a required-fields checklist and a violations list. Plans must copy this file verbatim.
- `plans/` is now gitignored. Plan files are local session state, not published artifacts.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- Behavioral guards persistence note: guards are active for the entire session, not just the first response.
- Step decomposition anti-pattern in SKILL.md: WRONG (horizontal slices) vs RIGHT (vertical slices).
- Vertical-slice step sizing guide in `create-plan.md` with visual comparison.
- Grilling intensity for clarification: walk each branch of the design tree, provide recommended answers, explore codebase instead of asking when possible.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **Restructured SKILL.md for agent compliance.** Plan format and step format are now inlined directly in SKILL.md so agents get the required output structure on the first read. Previously the plan template was 3 hops away (SKILL.md → create-plan.md → plan-template.md), causing 72% of plans to be non-compliant.
- SKILL.md reduced from 248 to 150 lines while adding the inlined plan format.
- Behavioral guards condensed from multi-bullet sections to one-line summaries.
- Added WRONG vs RIGHT anti-pattern comparison for plan format.
- Reference files are now supplementary (consulted when needed), not sequential prerequisites.
- `create-plan.md` updated to reference SKILL.md for plan format instead of deleted template file.

### Removed
- `assets/` directory and all template files (`plan-template.md`, `context-template.md`, `repo-map-template.md`). Content is now inlined in SKILL.md and respective reference files.
- Operating Modes table, Full workflow decision test, Skill Chain diagram, "Why Full Workflow Works" section, and Compact Variant section from SKILL.md (content preserved in condensed form or reference files).

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where agent would write only the first phase to the plan file when user says "start with phase 1" after approving a multi-phase plan in chat. Plan file now explicitly requires ALL steps for ALL phases before execution begins.
- Added Full Workflow Guard: plan file missing steps for later phases blocks execution until completed.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- Strengthened workflow guidance to require focused tests for new utilities/functions/modules when a test framework exists.
- Strengthened verification guidance to run configured pre-commit hooks and quality gates, including lefthook, before marking work complete.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- Mandatory workflow triage in `SKILL.md`, requiring agents to declare Lightweight or Full mode before code-task edits.
- Explicit Full workflow triggers for broad cleanup, lint/type/build/test cleanup, refactors, file deletion/moves, backend + UI changes, API/config contracts, source-of-truth docs, ambiguous scope, and tasks expected to touch more than 3 files.
- Full workflow pre-edit hard stop requiring a plan, an `IN_PROGRESS` step, and an edit mapped to that step before task target files are changed.
- Compact Full workflow guidance for broad cleanup/refactor/lint tasks.
- `AGENTS.md` repo-level instruction template to make workflow expectations visible outside the skill file.

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` to document triage-first behavior and stronger Full workflow expectations.
- Updated package metadata and included `AGENTS.md` in the package file list.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- Behavioral Guards that apply to all code-related tasks: think before coding, simplicity first, surgical changes, and goal-driven execution.

### Changed
- Reframed the skill into lightweight and full workflow modes so simple coding tasks use behavioral guidance without creating plan files.
- Updated package metadata to describe behavioral guards plus the structured planning workflow.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- `LICENSE` file (MIT).
- `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `package.json` with project metadata.
- `references/verify-step.md` — consolidated validation + testing + diff review into a single gate.
- `examples/add-email-validation/` — worked example showing populated `plan.md`, `repo-map.md`, and `context.md` mid-task.

### Changed
- **Consolidated references.** `validate-step.md`, `enforce-tests.md`, and `review-diff.md` merged into `verify-step.md` (three passes, one gate). `protect-code.md` folded into `execute-step.md` as a rules-of-thumb section. Net reduction: 4 files, ~460 lines.
- **Rewrote `SKILL.md`** (288 → ~180 lines): removed duplicated tables, simplified the skill chain diagram, deduped content with README.
- **Rewrote `README.md`** (247 → ~110 lines): stripped duplication with `SKILL.md`; README now focuses on install, purpose, and pointers.
- **Tightened `resume-workflow.md`** (340 → ~240 lines): compressed example, replaced prose with tables, removed duplicated "why" sections.
- **Simplified repo-map sync in `persist-plan.md`:** single-source procedure now lives in `maintain-repo-map.md`; other references link to it instead of repeating.
- Removed duplicate Status Values and File Relationships sections from `persist-plan.md` (canonical versions live in `SKILL.md`).
- Bumped version to `1.3.0`.

### Fixed
- Typo: "syncronized" → "synchronized" in `references/persist-plan.md`.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Guard clause in `SKILL.md` to prevent over-invocation of the workflow on
  simple tasks (single-file edits, quick fixes, clear requests, etc.).
- "Handling Partial Answers" section in `require-clarification.md` so the
  agent re-asks unanswered questions instead of assuming.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Context & Learnings** section in plans so decisions, gotchas, and
  patterns survive across sessions.
- Step isolation (explicit Prerequisites / Deliverables) enabling fresh
  sessions to pick up any step.
- Plan progress reminders after each step to prevent drift.
- Plan drift detection after unplanned work (bug fixes, user adjustments).
- Expanded documentation and workflow structure for context management.

### Changed
- Repo Map discipline is now enforced: a step cannot pass validation or be
  marked COMPLETED until the repo map reflects all touched files.
- Clarification workflow tightened — explicit user confirmation required
  before moving to planning.
